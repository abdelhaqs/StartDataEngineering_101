# SQL and Data Engineering Essentials

SQL is the bread and butter of data engineering. You need to know how to use SQL to manipulate data and deeply understand your data.

In these posts, you will review the basics of SQL and the approach to getting good at large-scale data processing with SQL, CTEs, and window functions.

In addition to knowing SQL, you should also know the context of using SQL for data engineering.

Here is a list of articles that you need to read for this lesson ðŸ‘‡

After reading the posts above, please respond to this email with your assignment (below) or send me a link to your GitHub repo with answers, and I will get back to you with feedback. This is your chance to apply your knowledge and skills in a practical scenario.

**Assignment:**

1. â€‹**Your assignment is to use the provided repository(click here) and generate dataâ€‹** as instructed in the README. Open the duckdb in the terminal with `./duckdb :memory: "INSTALL sqlite; LOAD sqlite;" && ./duckdb tpch.db`. Then, using the data model, answer the questions in the document below. All the necessary tables will be available in the duckdb terminal for your reference.**â€‹** Share your assignment with me by creating a repo (**like this one** if you haven't already) and writing down your notes/code under the folder for lesson 2.
